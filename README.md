# Project: Discord Bot

This repo contains a minimal working example of a Discord Bot for MP3 project for Intro to Engineering

The bot (once completed) will be able to return understandable answers to simple equations.

Functions: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Power, Sacrifice, Hello, Root, Plot, Backstory

If you're confused with some functions, just use the !Backstory command to learn :)
